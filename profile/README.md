## About

Skylence is an independent software development organization focused on building quality open-source tools and libraries. We create practical solutions that developers can rely on.

## Why @skylence

Publishing packages under `@skylence` instead of a personal name provides:

- **Privacy**: Keeps personal information separate from public packages
- **Professionalism**: Maintains a consistent identity across all projects
- **Flexibility**: Easier to collaborate or transfer ownership in the future
- **Focus**: Lets the code speak for itself without personal attribution

Simple as that. Good code, no unnecessary exposure.
