## About

[Skylence](https://skylence.be) is an independent software development organization focused on building high-quality open source packages and tools for the modern web ecosystem.

We create practical solutions that developers love to use:

- Clean, well-documented packages that solve real problems
- Tools that respect your time and system resources
- Libraries built with developer experience in mind

## Our Open Source Work

Since our founding, we've been committed to the open source community. Our packages focus on:

- **Developer Tools**: Utilities that make development more enjoyable
- **Web Standards**: Modern solutions using the latest web technologies
- **Performance**: Lightweight packages that don't bloat your projects
- **TypeScript First**: Type-safe solutions for better developer experience

## Why @skylence

We publish all our packages under the `@skylence` namespace. This provides a consistent, professional identity while maintaining personal privacy. It's about letting the code speak for itself.
